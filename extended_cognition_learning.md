# An n-of-1 randomized controlled trial comparing an extended cognition learning vs standard protocol in the training of orthopedic residents





## Abstract


## Introduction





## Methods

### Trial design

* Description of trial design (such as parallel, factorial) including allocation ratio
* Important changes to methods after trial commencement (such as eligibility criteria), with reasons

### Participants

* Eligibility criteria for participants
* Settings and locations where the data were collected

### Interventions


#### Extended cognition intervention

<!-- pressure and prestige -->

* topic determined by instructor
* instructor video - slides are presented, with a request for feedback on slide content as well as references
* pre-meeting readings - one review article delivered to residents one week prior to the group meeting
* group meeting with slides having structured engagement articulated as
    * clinical case <!-- might add cases from the service itself -->
    * discussion directed by pre-set questions <!-- might add resident names  http://goo.gl/fueWuw -->
    * questions with different difficulty levels to engage residents of all years
    * feedback at two levels
        * opinions contained in standard orthopedic textbooks
        * best available evidence from systematic reviews
* post-meeting - groups by post-graduate year, with daily clinical cases discussed on one day and then followed by feedback on the following day <!-- might have additional automated emails from mentor to provide positive reinforcement -->


#### Standard protocol


### Outcome variables

* Completely defined pre-specified primary and secondary outcome measures, including how and when they were assessed
* Any changes to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons

### Sample size
* How sample size was determined
* When applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines

### Randomization

* Sequence generation
    * Method used to generate the random allocation sequence
    * Type of randomisation; details of any restriction (such as blocking and block size)
* Allocation concealment mechanism
    * Mechanism used to implement the random allocation sequence (such as sequentially numbered containers), describing any steps taken to conceal the sequence until interventions were assigned
* Implementation
    * Who generated the random allocation sequence, who enrolled participants, and who assigned participants to interventions
* Blinding
    * If done, who was blinded after assignment to interventions (for example, participants, care providers, those assessing outcomes) and how
    * If relevant, description of the similarity of interventions

### Statistical methods
* Statistical methods used to compare groups for primary and secondary outcomes
* Methods for additional analyses, such as subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses
* Companion sites

### Semantic reproducible research

* Data
    * ontologies
    * formats
    * repositories
* Scripts
* Software
    * repository
* Literate programming 

### Diffusion

* Lay web site
* Dynamic graphic strategy
* Partnerships
* Participatory framework 
    * design
    * collection
    * interpretation
    * diffusion


## Results

### Participant flow (a diagram is strongly recommended)
* For each group, the numbers of participants who were randomly assigned, received intended treatment, and were analysed for the primary outcome
* For each group, losses and exclusions after randomisation, together with reasons

### Recruitment
* Dates defining the periods of recruitment and follow-up
* Why the trial ended or was stopped

### Baseline data
* A table showing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for each group

### Numbers analysed
* For each group, number of participants (denominator) included in each analysis and whether the analysis was by original assigned groups

### Outcomes and estimation
* For each primary and secondary outcome, results for each group, and the estimated effect size and its precision (such as 95% confidence interval)
* For binary outcomes, presentation of both absolute and relative effect sizes is recommended

### Ancillary analyses
* Results of any other analyses performed, including subgroup analyses and adjusted analyses, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory

### Harms
* All important harms or unintended effects in each group (for specific guidance see CONSORT for harms)
