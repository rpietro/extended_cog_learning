# Open access image repository and multidimensional computerized adaptive testing framework for resident education


## Abstract


## Introduction

* Case discussion as the pinacle behind quality education for healthcare providers <!-- ref -->. Despite its importance, not only most imaging repositories are closed within institutional walls, but they are not organized in a way that can provide learners with pathways progressively moving from day-to-day routine to more complex and not so frequent.
* case-based healthcare education 
* multidimensional computerized adaptive testing 
* The objective of this study is therefore to present a multi-institutional, open access image repository and multidimensional computerized adaptive testing framework for resident education.
